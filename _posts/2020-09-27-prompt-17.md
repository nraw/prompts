*I hate him. I hate him. I hate him!*
 
Wait, did it work???... No.....

*I hate him. I hate him. I hate him!*

It just doesn't make sense. None of it does. And she's not helping. She never helps me. She only helps him, always him. Always him...

*I hate him. I hate him. I hate him.*

Hold on. Maybe? No. Perhaps.. No. But,.. No. And she pointed out what I'm doing wrong, but that's not helping. I need to know how to do it. Telling me I'm wrong is easy. Even I can tell I'm wrong. Tell me, show me, teach me how. The way that works. The way it works for him.

*I hate him. I hate him. I hate him.*

And now this duality from you. I know he's better. I can see that. I can see how he's different. But why do you devote so much time to him? He's already ahead, leave him be. Can't you see I improved as well? I know it's not as much. I know it's not as fast. I know. But she's teaching him. All the after hours, all the extra effort, all the teachings I crave go to him, just him.

*I hate him. I hate him. I hated him.*

Now she's paying attention to me. Now she's telling me she's sorry. How she failed me. How knowing the limits is crucial. How not doing it wrong is more important than improving. I might have cared. I might have listened. Late, too late. I'm now stuck  with the reeking iron smell of blood and his blank silent stare looking into nothing from what remained of his unmoving corpse.

*I hated him. I hate her. I hate myself.*
